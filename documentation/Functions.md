##### Prerequisite:
The usage of the line number function requires having VSCode installed on your System. Not having VSCode installed will not create any output for Katacoda.

##### Name of the placeholder:
If you want to insert content into your code between two existing lines, take the previous line as your placeholder or use the option to insert at a line number. Add your placeholder into the new file or string, otherwise it will be replaced entirely.

A placeholder is optional. If you do not define a placeholder, the content in the existing file will be simply replaced by the new content.

Please try not to use custom placeholders. Keep in mind that you might want to build the project before changing them. Custom placeholders with a comment-syntax (e.g. "//PLACEHOLDER") will be removed by the console-environment and others might cause errors.

The option to insert at a linenumber uses a placeholder inserted by a script and just adds it at the step you also insert the content. 

##### Note:

    - **Required**
    - **Type**- String
    - **Description**- path to a new workspace (relative to working directory)
#### Example: 
* changeWorkspace("devonfw/workspaces/project")
will set the workspace directory to "[working directory]/devonfw/workspaces/project"

##### Note: 
1. No background scripts are running and Katacoda user don't have to manually execute them.

### ii. restoreWorkspace <a name="restoreWorkspace"></a>
This function is used to clone an existing GitHub repository to the working directory of the tutorial. It can be used to continue the tutorial with the state of a previous tutorial located in the repository to be cloned.
#### Parameter:
This function only consist of one parameter.
1. First parameter:
    - **Optional**
    - **Type**- String.
    - **Description**- Name of the workspace repository(Default is the playbook-name).

#### Arguments: 
* **User**
        -   (Optional)
        -   flag: --user 
        -   value: GitHub-username (Default is 'devonfw-tutorials')

Note: You can use a forked workspace-repository, if you add the username as argument. If the runner cannot find the workspace repository in the your repositories, it will use devonfw-tutorials instead. 

* **Branch**
        -   (Optional)
        -   flag: --branch
        -   value: the working branch (Default is its default-branch)

Note: You can use a different branch, if you add the working branch as argument. If the runner cannot find the branch in the cloned repository, it will use the default branch instead. 

* buildRun.sh --user [username] --branch [branch]

#### Example:

* restoreWorkspace() 
will clone "https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/[playbook-name]" into the workspace directory.

* restoreWorkspace({"workspace": [name]})
will clone "https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/[name]" into the workspace directory.

* **buildRun.sh --user [GitHub-name] --branch [branch]**
restoreWorkspace()
will run "git clone https://github.com/[GitHub-name]/[playbook-name]" and checkout in branch [branch]

#### details  
**workspace** 
    The default name of the workspace repository is a concatenation of "workspace-" and the name of your playbook-folder. 
    If you want to use another repository as workspace, you can specify the ending with {"workspace": [name]}.
    **example**
    "workspace-devon4ng" -> {"workspace" : "devon4ng"}

**local repository**
    You can use a local repository as workspace in the console environment for your tutorial. 
    Clone the forked repository next to the tutorial-compiler folder. Before cloning the GitHub repository, the console runner will always check, if there is a 'workspace-[name]'-folder next to the tutorial compiler first, and will use it instead. 

    Keep in mind, that it is a feature only implemented in the console environment. Other runners will clone the environment from GitHub.  

    |--tutorial-compiler
    |--tutorials 
    |--workspace-devon4ng

**workspace directory**

    If you call 'restoreDevonfwIde' or 'installDevonfwIde' before the 'restoreWorkspace'-function the workspace directory remains: 

        `'/root/workspaces/main'`

    If you don't call them, the workspace is changed to:

        `'/root/workspaces'`

## Custom Functions <a name="customFunctions"></a>

### i. addSetupScript <a name="addSetupScript"></a>
This function is used to add a script which is executed on startup of the tutorial.
#### Parameter:
This function consist of two parameters
1. First parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- String
    - **Description**- Path of the script (Linux). Relative to the playbook directory.
2. Second parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- String
    - **Description**- Path of the script (Windows). Relative to the playbook directory. 

#### Example:
* addSetupScript("assets/createProjectScript.sh", "assets/createProjectScript.ps1")

##### Note:
1. For Katacoda, only first parameter is required.
2. The script will run in the background while starting the tutorial. Katacoda user will have to wait till the script execution is in process. Once it is done it, Katacoda user will get the message and then command prompt will be available to Katacoda user.

***


### ii. executeCommand <a name="executeCommand"></a>
This function is used when you want to use a bash (or powershell/cmd on windows) command. 

#### Parameter: 
This function consists of four parameters.

1. First parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- String
    - **Description**-It contains the input which is a command. The command that will be executed on Windows.
    
2. Second parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- String
    - **Description**-It contains the input which is a command. The command that will be executed on Linux.
    
3. Third parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- JSON object
    - **Description**- This parameter consist of three attribute. It is a JSON object with optional fields
        * First attribute: (Optional) Directory where the command will be executed, if not in current directory (relative to workspace)
            Example: {"dir": string}
        * Second attribute: (Optional) Synchronous or asynchronous process. Use asynchronous when starting a server. Default is synchronous. 
            Example: {"asynchronous": boolean}
        * Third attribute: (Optional) Array of arguments 
            Example: {"args": string[]}
  
4. Fourth parameter:
    - **Required**
    - **Type**- JSON object
    - **Description**- This parameter consist of three attributes which are the assertion information. Assertion information is needed if you start a server to check server                            availability. Only required when you start a asynchronous server. This parameter is only needed when the command is an asynchronous command.
        * First attribute: "startupTime" which is the time in seconds to wait before checking if the server is running
        * Second attribute: "port" which is the port number on which the server is running
        * Third attribute: "path" which is the path to the URL path on which is checked if the server is running

#### Commands:
It is needed to pass a command for Windows and also for Linux-based systems because both systems will always be tested.

##### Assertion information
startupTime = Time in seconds to wait before checking if the server is running
port: Port on which the server is running
path: The URL path on which is checked if the server is running
interval: The availability of the server is checked in the given interval
* (Required) port: will throw error if no port is given.
* (Optional) path: subpath which should be pinged, i.e: if localhost:8081/jumpthequeue should be checked path should be "jumpthequeue". DEFAULT: ""
* (Optional) interval: interval in seconds in which the server should be pinged until it is available or timeouted. DEFAULT: 5 seconds
* (Optional) startupTime: seconds until a timeout will occur and an error will be thrown. DEFAULT: 10 minutes

#### Example:

* executeCommand("node", "node" ,{"args": ["-v"]})
Will create a command for executing node -v .

* executeCommand("somePollingScript.ps1","bash somePollingScript.sh", {"dir": "data/setup", "args": ["--params 5"]})
Will create a command to execute the script in the directory with the parameter --params 5 and in the current command prompt. The command prompt will be blocked until you stop the script.

* executeCommand("someServerScript.ps1","bash someServerScript.sh", {"asynchronous": true, "args":["-port 8080"] },{"port":8080 , "startupTime": 20, "path": "some/path/", "interval": 2})
Starting a server in a new terminal. You have to specify the port for testing, the other parameters are optional. The startupTime can specify how long the runner will wait for a response from the server process and with interval you can set the frequenzy for the server testing. The path is the subpath from your server that should be reached.
