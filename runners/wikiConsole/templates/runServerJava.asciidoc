== Run Java Server



=== Prerequisites
* Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)

=== Starting the server

First, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd <%= server_path; %>`.

Afterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
This command will start the Java server.

<% if(port){ %>

=== Startup Assertion

You can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:<%= port; %>/<%= app_path; %>` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.

Example: `curl -Is localhost:<%= port; %>/<%= app_path; %> | head -n 1`

This command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.

<% } %>
